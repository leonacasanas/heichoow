                            <p>Fallout Restoration Mod (TeamX)  Game Restoration Mod Part 1: "Invasive procedures". An invasion of mutants army in all major towns has been restored. As long as Master exists, he and his army will slowly invade Wasteland. So, yeah, tried to start up Fallout 1 today after nabbing it off GoG a while back only to find that the game refuses to fit my screen properly, cutting off some stuff at the bottom and top. After googling around, i have learned i need the high res patch to tweak the resolution. But i also learned about the restoration mod and am wondering if i should also download that? I was reading a description of it that started to wander into spoiler territory, so i thought I would just ask instead Is it fixt or a full restoration? I can't seem to find the download link for this, and after seeing those posts from FO2, i decided to pop in my collection disc and play through them again. I found the FO2 mod, but can't Author: Topic: Fallout 1 Restoration Mod - баги, отзывы, предложения (Read 4882 times). Anybody know what mod has other filtering methods besides bi-linear filtering? Like for example 2xsal and other forms of pixel art scaling? I know they exist, I read about people who bought certain retail configurations which included such mods integrated. 
As the title implies, I’m wondering if the fixt mod or any other mods are included in the fallout 1 version on steam. I’m planning to play with GeForce Now on my Mac but i don’t think I’ll be able to get fixt to work with that service if it’s not already built in. Thanks in advance. Здравствуйте, для начала хочу выразить благодарность всем кто еще занимается доведением до ума первого Фаллаута, и в особенности уважаемой wg за этот мод. This mod was only out in Czech for a number of years and it has been sung praises ever since. The English version will be out in a week and I couldn't be more excited. From wikipedia: "The mod has received universal acclaim upon its release and was treated by critics as a full-length game. The average score of the mod was over 90%. The mod was elected 6th best game of the year by readers of Bonusweb. Readers of Eurogamer elected it to be third best role-playing game of the year." Watch. I thought to myself- "Gee, I've been playing these Fallout games and I really like the post-apocalyptic setting, but I also really like oldschool cRPGs like Neverwinter Nights, Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, Planescape Torment, and so on. But this Fallout thing isn't really much of an RPG any more." SO, do you guys think this Wasteland2 would  I ask this because I recently bought both 1 and 2, and although 2 worked fine with the restoration mod Fallout 1 won't even begin an install even after going through compatability modes, trying to copy the CD content onto my laptop etc all I get is "Windows doesn't support this version" Also I say physical copy because I really don't want to buy it off Steam as IMO it's quite expensive.
